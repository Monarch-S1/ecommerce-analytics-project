# 📊 E-Commerce Growth Analytics Dashboard

## 🚀 Project Summary

Analyzed **525,462 raw transactions** from a UK-based online retail company (Dec 2009 – Dec 2010) to uncover revenue drivers, customer behavior patterns, and growth opportunities. After extensive data cleaning, **399,569 valid revenue-generating transactions** across **4,285 customers** were analyzed, producing **$8.64M in total revenue**.

This project demonstrates end-to-end data cleaning, business analysis, and dashboard development using Excel and Power BI.

## 🎯 Business Objective

Although the company had large volumes of transactional data, it lacked clarity on:

- Who are the most valuable customers?
- What drives seasonal revenue spikes?

## 🛠 Solution

Developed an interactive **Power BI dashboard** featuring:

- KPI Overview (Revenue, Orders, AOV, Customers)
- Monthly revenue trend & seasonality analysis
- RFM customer segmentation
- Pareto (ABC) product classification
- Geographic revenue distribution
- Interactive filtering for deeper analysis
